grabbed the liana first. He pulled firmly to find out if it would hold his bodyweight. He took a step back to get started and jumped without any hesitation. At first all was going well but halfway across the river the rope started ripping and suddenly the branch on which it was attached, snapped. His swing came to an abrupt stop, as the liana completely tore off and P fell into the raging river. When he hit the water, his head struck a stone making him lose consciousness. J had to react quickly and jumped into the water, trying to save her brother. But the blood of PÂ´s head injury had already attracted something in the water. It looked like a kind crocodile but nothing J had ever seen. It was bigger, more threatening and significantly faster. Before J could do anything about it, the amphibic creature ate P and then attacked J leaving her injured in the water. She drowned slowly.
