With a mixture of Confusion and curiosity P and J approached the cabin to inspect it. It looked very old, rundown and almost like it was standing there for years, which baffled them, as they´ve seen it for the first time. At this time, they decided to go inside. When both tapped in, all around them turned white and they start hearing a strange noise.
P and J decided to go look outside what caused that loud roaring noise. They opened the door slowly and went outside. That’s when they realized, that the whole environment around them had changed. The forest was gone and replaced by lush green fields and mountains surrounding them. On top of everything, they discovered footprints as big as their heads just a few feet away from their porch, leading towards a lonely mountain in the distance.
