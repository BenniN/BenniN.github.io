Scared of the situation, the two stayed in the tree for hours, trying to outwait the Raptors, so that they would get bored and find other prey. That’s when they felt a sudden and strong rumble of the ground. The mountain in front of them was shaking, they were experiencing a volcanic earthquake. And that’s when it hit them. The volcano they were basically under, was going to erupt. The Raptors made no indication of leaving, so the kids had to stay on the tree and await the eruption. As the situation got tenser and the earth was shaking even harder all Dinosaurs started leaving, including the raptors. That was the cue for the kids to leave but it was too late. With a big bang the volcano exploded, and lava was shooting out of the crater. The explosion killed the kids instantly.
