P and J came to the decision that it maybe was best to leave. Their mum must have been worried sick, and they were afraid that Brachiosauruses werenÂ´t the only Dinosaurs here. Scared of what else they might approach, they took the book and opened it together, as they did when they were in the attic. At this point it started happening all over again. The earth around them started rumbling and they became very dizzy until the finally fainted. When they woke up, they were lying in the Attic of their home, relieved that their little adventure was over.
