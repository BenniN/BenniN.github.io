The Kids knew, how dangerous Raptors could be, so they made the decision to run away and maybe find a hiding spot in the trees. They found a climbable tree that was relatively close to them, so they ran to it and climbed up. On top of the tree, the view was astonishing. They just now realized, how many dinosaurs there were. In front of them was a giant mountain that almost looked like a volcano and it was surrounded by all kinds of dinosaurs. The Raptor at the bottom of the tree now had gathered some other Raptors to help him stalk his prey. It was clear the Raptors werenâ€™t going anywhere.
