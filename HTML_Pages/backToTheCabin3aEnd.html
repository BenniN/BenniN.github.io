Confused about the whole situation, the two went back to the cabin, sat down and just waited to be teleported back. For a few hours nothing happened until they heard a loud thunder in the distance. From then on, the distant thunder developed to a fast approaching thunderstorm and suddenly it was right above them. A lightning hit the tree in front of their little cabin, making it catch fire, which then spread to the cabin. The siblings ran outside hastily to find a save shelter. Luckily, they saw a cave at a nearby hill. They took the chance and went to the cave. As they settled down and tried to catch their breath again, they felt a light earthquake and a following harder one. The earth was shaking, thatâ€™s why J stood up and went outside, just to witness, that the mountain nearby was a volcano that was just erupting. She went back inside to her brother to tell him, just when a third earthquake hit. That one was extremely strong, which made the cave collapse in the entrance region. P and J were captured in tons of stone. There was no way of getting out.
