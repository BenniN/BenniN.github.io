The two siblings decided to clear the room but to stay in the house, as they wanted to play in the attic anyway. The attic was very old and stuffed with dusty books and toys. But one book in particular caught their eye as it was very big and decorated with drawings of dinosaurs. Thatâ€™s why they decided to open it together. By doing so, the whole room started rumbling like the earth was shaking and everything turned pitch black. Both siblings fainted. As they woke up, they realized, they were laying somewhere in nature, on the ground, no civilisation in sight. The Landscape was green and lush, with fields as far as the horizon. Beside them was the Dinosaur book. As they were standing up, they started seeing unexpected things. They were amongst actual Dinosaurs, to be exact Brachiosauruses.
