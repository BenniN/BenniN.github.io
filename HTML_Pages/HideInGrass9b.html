Because they were exposed in the big open fields, P and J tried to hide in the grass, but one Pterosaurs had already spotted them. He started to nosedive and chase them. Thatâ€™s when P and J jumped up and ran in different directions. As they split up, they made an even easier target for the Dinosaur. P got attacked and wounded by the Pterosaurs and fell to the ground. As J turned around to look for her brother, she witnessed an epic battle. The Pterosaurs, which attacked her brother, was now battling a Triceratops, which tried to protect her brother. The two were fighting for their life. J took the chance and ran to her brother to help him get up. P and J tried to flee from the battleground and look for a place to hide. Nearby was a cave, in which they could find shelter.
