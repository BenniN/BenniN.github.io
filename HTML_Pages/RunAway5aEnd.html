Scared of the Raptor the kids started running. The Raptor followed them as suddenly he was hit in the head by a giant rock. The mountain they were close to, was in fact a volcano, which started erupting, causing a landslide to go off and shooting some huge rocks through the air like missiles. The Raptor was wounded, which was the only chance for the kids to escape and get home. They started running, even crossed the river safely and made it to the hut. The volcano was about to erupt completely as the kids made it inside the cabin. With a big bang he exploded, and the blast wave knocked the kids out completely. All around them went pitch black. As they opened their eyes again, they knew they were back in the forest in front of their house. Their little adventure was over, and they survived the eruption of the volcano.
