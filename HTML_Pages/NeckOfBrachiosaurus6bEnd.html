    <title>Neck of Brachiosaurus</title>

<body>
Knowing that the Raptors were trying to outwait them, the children made the decision to jump on the Neck of a Brachiosaurus which was eating leaves off their tree. They were safe for now, which the Raptors realized, as they finally went away.
Just as the Raptors were out of sight, the siblings decided to climb down the Brachiosaurus and run back to the hut to go home. As they were back on the ground they started running. They even passed the river safely, but just in front of the hut, they were captured by one Raptor again. He attacked J and wounded her badly. She died instantly. The devastated and scared P realized that he couldnâ€™t do anything for his sister except saving himself in the cabin. He ran inside and locked the door and window. All around him turned pitch black. As he opened his eyes again, he knew he was back in the forest in front of his house, but his sister was missing. It was not just a bad dream.
