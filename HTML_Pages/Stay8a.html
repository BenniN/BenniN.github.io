Given that it was a wonder that the kids landed in the land of dinosaurs and that probably no one else would experience something like this ever again, they choose to stay a little longer. To survive here, P and J needed to find shelter, food and water. As they were exploring their surroundings before, they decided to walk to the giant mountain, in order to find shelter in a cave or something like that. To do so they had to cross a river.The river seemed very wide, and the water was deep and rough. That’s when they detected a liana hanging from a tree on the shore, just high enough to swing over the water.The river seemed very wide, and the water was deep and rough.
