    <title>Back to Brachiosaurus</title>
</head>
<body>
Surrounded by even more kinds of Dinosaurs they decided to go back to the Brachiosauruses, because they were the friendliest looking and especially calm. The Kids ran back to the spot where they´ve arrived, just to find out, that the book with which they came here, was gone. They must have forgotten it in their hurry and now they had no idea how to get back home, as this book was their only clue, of how they might have gotten there. Desperate, tired and hungry the kids had no option as to adapt to the idea to stay amongst the Dinosaurs. That’s when they suddenly heard a loud rumble behind them. It sounded like thousands of stomping Dinosaurs. The kids jumped up ready to flight, but it was too late. A giant herd of Triceratopses, startled by a T-rex, overran the kids.
