Scared of how dangerous the Dinosaur could be and the given fact that the book was basically destroyed, J figured it was a lost cause. She went back to her brother to tell him the news. P wasn´t satisfied with J attempts to safe them, so he convinced her to go back to the spot and get the book, even if she had to resort to violence. So, J went back to the spot, walked up to the baby and tried to pull out the book out of the baby´s mouth. While she was having a fight over the book with the dinosaur, she didn’t realize, that something big was getting closer. It was the mother of the Nest, a T-rex, which obviously saw J as a threat to its children. Before J could even realize what was happening, the T-rex already attacked and ate her. The wounded P couldn’t do anything without his sister, so he bled to death.
