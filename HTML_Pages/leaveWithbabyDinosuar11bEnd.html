J figured it was best to leave the book with the baby dinosaur and maybe wait, till it would lose interest over it. J sat in ambush, for a few hours and the baby finally dropped the book and went to sleep. As the mother of the Nest was nowhere to be seen J crept up to the Nest, took the book and ran away as fast as possible. She arrived at her brother and they took the book and opened it together, as they did when they were in the attic. At this point it started happening all over again. The earth around them started rumbling and they became very dizzy until the finally fainted. When they woke up, they were lying in the Attic of their home, relieved that their little adventure was over.
