P and J approached the water and went inside slowly. The stream was very strong, but they were good swimmers and after a few minutes the shore was getting closer. The water became less deep which caused the siblings to get out of the water unscathed. However, it was at this point, where P and J realized that they were being followed by something. Something sneaky and fast. It was at this exact moment they saw the creature because it was lurking in the bushes right beside them. And thatâ€™s when they realized. They were among actual Dinosaurs. All this time P and J had been in this place and only now they saw that a Raptor was following them.
